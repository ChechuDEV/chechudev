        I am currently working on a project called MPM (Mod Plugin Manager) for Infinity Projects. I am also working as
        a Freelancer on Fiverr on various projects. Next, you can see some of the featured projects I have worked on.

            <p>
                MPM is a Minecraft plugin that serves as an API for developers to easily create plugins with custom
                items, blocks and more with custom textures. It also allows compatibility with other plugins
                using this API, effectively preventing conflicts.

            <p>
                This project is a visualisation of various sorting algorithms, it runs in the browser and allows
                the user to change the speed of the visualisation and the size of the array to sort. It also plays
                some sounds while the array is being sorted.
            </p>
            <p>
                It currently features two basic sorting algorithms: Selection Sort and Insertion Sort.
            </p>
            <p>
                More algorithms will be added in the future, and you can already see some of them on my TikTok account.

            <p>
                MCDevTools is a web application that allows Minecraft plugin developers to easily test their plugins
                on a remote and fast server. This was created to help developers who don't have a powerful computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, it would also feature the ability to include bots to test the plugins with many players.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still haven't published the source code for this project. The infrastructure/backend
                is done with Go, while frontend is made with NextJS. Unfortunately, the project is currently
                on hold.
